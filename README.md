👋 Hi, I’m @ParmjitKS
👀 I’m interested in developing applications that make a positive difference in as many people as I can, especially for the ones who are challenged more than the average person.  For me it's crucial to get the basics right, so my focus is in the areas of food, health, home, education and clothes. 
🌱 I’m currently learning React and Redux
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every single project that I am involved.  Currently have MVP for food and looking for people to take this work and empower users.
📫 How to reach me, leave a message and I'll contact you.
